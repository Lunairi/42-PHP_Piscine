# 42-PHP_Piscine
Upload of the projects/days I completed during the PHP Piscine, mostly a reference for people and 42 students.

I did not complete all the days since I ended up working on other web projects and 42 projects, but overall was a great piscine to learn web stuff.

This repo has all my PHP work that I was able to complete during my time, completed October 29, 2017.
